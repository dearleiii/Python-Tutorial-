### Identation 
Python use identation as coding blocks 

### Data types & variables 
In C: need to implement data types from scratch, design memory structure, mem arrangement;

Python: dict

Variable names: 

C/C++/Java: declare variable names, as reserving memory 

  int x = 42;
  
Python: can change both value & type  

  i = 42
  
  reason: python variables are references to objects (an arbitary data type)
  
### Naming convention 

### Immutable Strings

>>> s = "Some things are immutable!"

>>> s[-1] = "."
'''
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
'''


>>> a is b: check the same memory location 
  
>>> a == b: check content only 



### Sequential data types 
6 sequential data types in python: 
Same functions and syntax are used for them; 

i.e. len(country)

- Strings 
- Byte sequences 
- byte arrays 
- lists
- tuples 
- range objects 

>>> lst = ["Vienna", "London", "Paris", "Berlin", "Zurich", "Hamburg"]

>>> print(lst[0])

>>> print(lst[-1]): Print last one 
  
  
### Lists
